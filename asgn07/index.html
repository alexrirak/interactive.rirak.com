		<h1>Assignment 7</h1>
		
		<p>For the tracking assignment I decided to work with tracking fiducial markers. From the demos we have seen in class
		this seemed like the best way of tracking something in space. I decided to work with using the markers to control 
		something on screen rather than augmenting reality. In this application a fiducial marker is used as a point to generate
		many different particles. The particles act on their own but can be customized using other fiducial markers. I
		crated a few custom markers to make it easier to separate them and know which one does what. By default the colors 
		of the particles are random. I made three different markers which can lock the colors of the particles to a 
		specific color (red, blue and green). Additionally the particles randomly generate a shape upon creation. I created
		fiducial markers which allow to lock the shape too (ellipse and rectangle). The final effect turned out to be pretty cool.</p>
		
		<p>Here are the custom markers I created: </p>

		<p>Getting this set up in a way so that the markers could be easily recognized and the lighting would not interfere was kinda 
		difficult. I ended up having to do it in a dark room with the web cam of my laptop pointed at my desk. Here are a few photos of the set up:</p>
