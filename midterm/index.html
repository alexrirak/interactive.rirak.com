		<h3>Midterm Project Proposal</h3>
		
		<p>For my midterm project I am planning to remake the classic Super Mario Brothers game. 
		It will use the tile game techniques which we have discussed in class. I am planning to 
		implement one level at first and then go on to implement further levels if I am able to 
		and time allows.</p>
		
		<p>I have found a <a href="http://www.pcmariogames.com/super-mario-bros.php" target="_blank">website</a> which has a flash version of the game which I will use as the
		model to base my game off of. <a href="http://www.pcmariogames.com/super-mario-bros.php" target="_blank"> This </a> is the website.
		</p>
		
		<p>I have also found a <a href="http://www.mariowiki.com/Super_Mario_Bros." target="_blank">Mario Wiki</a> which includes details about the game if I need further 
		clarification of anything. <a href="http://www.mariowiki.com/Super_Mario_Bros." target="_blank"> This </a> is the link to that wiki.
		
		<h4>Update</h4>
		<p>I have started working on the game and have made some progress. I started with the sample code we looked at in class and progressed from there. <a href="update1/index.html"> Click Here </a> for the full update </p>
