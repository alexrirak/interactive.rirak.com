		<h1>Assignment 3</h1>
		
		<p>For this assignment I decided to build off of my <a href="../asgn02/">previous game</a>. <a href="#game">(jump to game)</a></p>
		
		<p>I retained all the features of the previous game and added some new ones.</p>
		
		<p>Here is a list of new features added:
		<ol>
		<li>Pause Menu which shows directions for playing the game and allows you to select a difficulty level (with its own background)</li>
		<li>An Easy and a Hard level. The level changes the types of barriers and the speed of the player</li>
		<li>Background music which loops in the background</li>
		<li>Barriers in the game. (The easy level barriers are a little easier to avoid than the hard level barriers)</li>
		<li>Hitting a barrier triggers a "boing" noise</li>
		<li>Made use of methods to keep code more organized. The draw function just has a few simple method calls and all the logic is contained in those methods.</li>
		</ol>
		
		With these modifications in place the game was more interesting to play and felt more like my own. Here is the finished game:

		<p>This week we also had a chance to play with a MakeyMakey board and create a potential controller for our game. My group created arrow keys out of aluminium foil and used Play-doh to secure it down to a piece of paper. 
			The user would wear an aluminium bracelet and be able to push down on the "buttons". This created a directional pad which allows a character (such as the one in the above game) to be controlled simply by touching these aluminium keys.
				Here are some pictures of the finished controller:</p>
