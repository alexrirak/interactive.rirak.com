		<h1>Assignment 6</h1>
		
		<p>This assignment was to create a software mirror. I played around with some of the various strategies
		we looked at in class and choose a combination which i thought created a cool effect. The video is
		displayed four times (but being brought in once). There is an effect applied to every other pixel
		and the effect is different in each version. The top left version has every other pixel only display its
		red color, the top right version has every other pixel only display its green color, the bottom left
		version has every other pixel only display its blue color and the bottom right version has every
		other pixel displayed in grayscale. On top of that the user can perform manipulations with the mouse.
		Moving the mouse left and right begins to partially mirror the video depending on how far the mouse is moved.
		This effects all four versions and allows a user to create cool effects of moving from one version to the
		other (demonstrated in video). Moving the mouse up and down changes the size of the squares which are used to
		render the video. I decided to limit them from getting too big because this made it impossible to see the
		video and took away from the effect.</p>

		<p>Unfortunatly video does not work on the web so I cannot post the full version of the software mirror. This
			is a video of it working on my machine. The cursor is not visible in the video but it is moving to make
			the adjustments outlined in the above explanation: </p>
