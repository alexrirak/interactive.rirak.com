		<h1>Assignment 4</h1>
		
		<p>This assignment was to create a version of the classic Whack-A-Mole game. 
		I decided to stay with my Angry Birds theme. The interesting thing about this 
		assignment is that it was done using object oriented programming. The "mole" 
		(in this case a pig) was written as a class and then multiple instances 
		(9 to be exact) of that class were created. Each "mole" keeps track of its
		own state and position. The main program just keeps track of the score.</p>
		
		<p>Here are some extras i added to make the game more interesting:</p>
		<ol>
		<li>Directions (and title) displayed at the top</li>
		<li>Sounds when a pig is hit</li>
		<li>King Pig which gives 5 points instead of 1 for being hit</li>
		<li>Bird which subtracts 5 points if its hit</li>
		<li>Hitting the bird triggers a different sound</li>
		<li>The hammer has a down effect when the mouse is pressed</li>
		</ol>
		
		<p>Here is the finished game: </p>
